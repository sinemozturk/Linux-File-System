# Unlocking DevOps Efficiency: The Crucial Role of Linux File System Understanding

In the world of Devops, mastering the details of the Linux file system is not just a benefit ‚Äî it is mandatory. What I mean by that , most of the Devops projects are being managing and deploying applications by Linux servers.First of all, I want to share why Linux is the best choice when it comes to Devops practice,

‚úîÔ∏èIt is an open-source operating system which means it‚Äôs source code is publicly available for anyone to use, modify and distribute. It helps the Devops teams for collaboration, innovation and tranparency within the team. The team can tailor Linux distributions to meet specific requirements, can eliminate the components and packages according to project‚Äôs needs.

‚úîÔ∏èLinux provides a powerful command-line interface that allow the Devops team to perform a wide range of tasks efficiently and programatically. It is fast and improve the productivity.

‚úîÔ∏èThe stability of Linux distributions ensures consistent performance and uptime, essential for DevOps practices focused on continuous integration, delivery, and deployment.

üìåOverall, Linux‚Äôs open-source nature, flexibility, powerful CLI, rich ecosystem, stability, scalability, and community support make it the preferred choice for DevOps practices, empowering teams to innovate, automate, and deliver value efficiently in today‚Äôs fast-paced digital landscape.

## Linux File System
The Linux file system is the structure and organization used by the Linux operating system to store, retrieve, and manage data on storage devices such as hard drives, solid-state drives (SSDs), and other storage media. It provides a hierarchical structure for organizing files and directories, similar to other Unix-like operating systems.


Here‚Äôs a breakdown of key components and concepts within the Linux file system:

- Root (/) Directory: The top-level directory in the Linux file system hierarchy. All other directories and files are subdirectories or files contained within the root directory.
Directories: Directories are containers used to organize files and other directories. They function similarly to folders in other operating systems. Directories can be nested within other directories to create a hierarchical structure.

- Files: Files are individual units of data stored on a storage device. They can contain text, programs, configurations, multimedia, or any other type of data.

- File Permissions: Linux uses a permissions system to regulate access to files and directories. Each file and directory has associated permissions that specify which users or groups can read, write, or execute them.

- Users and Groups: Linux employs a multi-user environment where each user can have specific permissions and access rights. Users are typically assigned to one or more groups, which helps in managing permissions more efficiently.

- Mount Points: In Linux, storage devices are attached to the file system through mount points. When a storage device is mounted, its contents become accessible at the specified mount point within the file system hierarchy.

- File System Types: Linux supports various file system types, including ext4, XFS, Btrfs, and many others. Each file system type has its own features, performance characteristics, and suitability for different use cases.

- Virtual File Systems (VFS): The Linux kernel abstracts access to different types of file systems through the Virtual File System layer. This layer allows the kernel to interact with various file system types using a common interface.

- File System Hierarchy Standard (FHS): The FHS is a standard that defines the directory structure and organization for Linux distributions. It ensures consistency across different distributions and simplifies software development and system administration.

- Special Files: Linux includes special files such as device files (/dev), symbolic links (symlinks), named pipes (FIFOs), and sockets. These files provide access to devices, facilitate inter-process communication, and enable various system functionalities.

Overview of commonly found directories in a Linux file system and their purposes


You can connect a Linux machine and run following commands by order to see full list of directries;

```bash
sudo snap install tree
tree / -L 1
```

- /bin: Essential command binaries ‚Äî Contains executable programs that are fundamental to the system‚Äôs operation, such as basic system commands like ls, cp, mv, etc.

- /boot: System boot loader files ‚Äî Contains files needed for the boot process, including the kernel, bootloader configuration, and other essential boot-related files.

- /dev: Device files ‚Äî Contains special files that represent devices attached to the system, including hard drives, partitions, input/output devices, etc.

- /etc: Host-specific system-wide configuration files ‚Äî Contains configuration files and directories for system-wide settings, network configuration, services, and other administrative tasks.

- /home: User home directories ‚Äî Contains home directories for regular users, where they store personal files, configurations, and user-specific settings.

- /lib: Shared library modules ‚Äî Contains shared libraries used by executable programs in /bin and /sbin, as well as libraries used by programs in /usr.

- /media: Media files such as CD-ROM ‚Äî Typically used as a mount point for removable media devices like USB drives, CD-ROMs, and DVDs.

/mnt: Temporarily mounted file systems ‚Äî Historically used as a mount point for temporarily mounted file systems, though /mnt is often used less frequently with the adoption of more dynamic mounting techniques.

/opt: Add-on application software packages ‚Äî Used for installing additional software packages that are not part of the default system installation.

/proc: Automatically generated file system ‚Äî A virtual file system that provides information about processes and system resources in real-time, represented as files and directories.

/root: Home directory for the root user ‚Äî The home directory for the root user, typically used for administrative tasks and system configuration.

/run: Run-time program data ‚Äî Contains system information and run-time data for processes, including PID files, UNIX domain sockets, and other transient files.

/sbin: System binaries ‚Äî Contains essential system administration binaries, typically used by the root user for system maintenance and configuration.

/srv: Site-specific data served by this system ‚Äî Used for data served by the system, such as website content or FTP directories.

/sys: Virtual directory providing information about the system ‚Äî Contains information about the kernel and connected devices, presented as a hierarchical file system.

/tmp: Temporary files ‚Äî Used for storing temporary files created by various programs and services. Files in this directory are typically deleted upon system reboot.

/usr: Read-only user files ‚Äî Contains user-related programs, libraries, documentation, and other read-only files used by regular users.

/var: Files that are expected to continuously change ‚Äî Contains variable data such as log files, spool directories, temporary files, mail, and other files that are expected to change during normal system operation.


Examples with most common tools
In a typical Linux system, various tools and files are stored and utilized across different directories. Let‚Äôs go through some commonly used tools and where they‚Äôre stored or run, along with the directories they are typically associated with:
